    "# MNIST Example Neutral Network in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "To really dive into AI, we need to use one of the many frameworks. TensorFlow is a machine learning library from Google, and is the most well known and widely used to do this kind of work. It has several layers, allowing you to get arbitrarily deep into the weeds when it comes to coding machine learning code. However, for the purposes of this demo, we will stay at a fairly high level, using the packaged \"Keras\" library. Keras lets us look at neural networks in terms of layers of nodes, and is generally easy to work with for new users. It doesn't require a lot of the advanced math that some lower layers might need, instead just requiring a general understanding of when to apply certain techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will be using TensorFlow's Keras library to work on the MNIST dataset from before. While it is possible for non-AI code to do things like handwritten digit classification, AI is currently the state of the art. It also has the secondary benefit of being significantly easier in some cases to program. Some other approaches involve decision trees or support vector machines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine)\n",

    "It's important to understand why we have a separate dataset for training and testing. Neural networks are designed to \"learn\" associations in data by looking at large sets of data. However, it can also learn some bad habits, for example if all of the digits were written by someone right-handed, it may learn habits associated with right handed digits and perform poorly when it comes to digits written with the left hand. This learning of peculiarities of a given sample of data is called \"overfitting\". It's a problem that arises when a training dataset doesn't fully accurately reflect reality. It is related to, but not the same as having a \"biased\" AI. There are several examples in the news lately of AI having biases for all sorts of reasons. One good way to help ensure good AI performance in terms of overfitting is to ensure that it can perform well on data that it hasn't seen before. To do this, we separate some of the data into a test dataset that is only used to evaluate the performance of the AI, and not to train it. This is only one tool, and bias and overfitting can occur in many ways, but it's always good practice to evaluate the AI on a test dataset to ensure it hasn't overfit to the training dataset.\n",
